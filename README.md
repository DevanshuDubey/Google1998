# Google Clone 1998
A simple clone of the Google homepage as it appeared in 1998. This project demonstrates the basic structure and design of Google’s first web interface using HTML and CSS.

I used the Wayback Machine as a reference. I searched for Google’s homepage from 1998 on the Wayback Machine, which showed me a saved version of Google’s page from that year. Here’s the exact snapshot I used as a reference:
https://web.archive.org/web/19981202230410/http:/www.google.com:80/

Some links in the original 1998 page no longer exist. To keep the experience functional while still resembling the original, I used modern Google URLs as replacements:

Doodles: The original site had a link to "Google! Logos." I replaced this with the current Doodles page, which features Google’s logos and special artwork.
About Google: Originally, a link called "Company Info" led to Google’s basic company information. I updated this to the modern About Google page, which serves a similar purpose.
Stanford Search: The archived page featured a "Stanford Search" link as a sample search. I replaced it with a modern site-specific search on the Stanford domain.
Linux Search: Another sample search for "Linux" was linked, so I created a Linux-specific search using the current Google search interface.


Features:
Centered Google logo with input search bar
"Google Search" and "I'm Feeling Lucky" buttons
Links for special searches and company information
